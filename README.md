Course materials for teaching R
=======

This repository will hold materials for teaching R (principally to beginners). I'm teaching an initial version of this course as a one-day seminar at Aarhus University on 2013-11-14. My plan is to create branches for each iteration of the course and merge the most recent version back into the master branch, preserving each version of the course separately for posterity.

The motivation behind building a syllabus and materials on GitHub is free dissemination of course materials for the benefit of other instructors and students.

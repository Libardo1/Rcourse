Course materials for teaching R
=======

This repository will hold materials for teaching R (principally to beginners). I'm teaching an initial version of this course as a one-day seminar at Aarhus University on November 14, 2013 for faculty and PhD students of the Department of Political Science and Government. I'm gradually adding material as the course approaches. Currently you'll find an up-to-date list of [resources](Resources.md) that will be useful for getting started with and becoming more sophisticated with R.

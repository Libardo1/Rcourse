# Basic Math Tutorial

# R enables you to do basic math, using all the usual operators:
# Addition
2+2
1+2+3+4+5

# Subtraction
10-1
5-6

# Multiplication
2*2
1*2*3

# Division
4/2
10/2/4

# Parentheses can be used to adjust order of operations:
10/2+2
10/(2+2)
(10/2)+2

# Check your intuition by checking order of operations on your own functions.

# Exponents and square roots involve intuitive syntax:
2^2
3^4
1^0
sqrt(4)

# So do logarithms:
log(0)
log(1)

# and logarithms to other bases, including arbitrary ones:
log10(1)
log10(10)
log2(1)
log2(2)
logb(1,base=5)
logb(5,base=5)

# natural number exponents use a similar syntax:
exp(0)
exp(1)

# There are also tons of other mathematical operations, like:
# Absolute value
abs(-10)

# Factorials:
factorial(10)

# and Choose:
choose(4,1)
choose(6,3)
